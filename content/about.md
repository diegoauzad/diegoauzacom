I am a mobile developer interested in getting things done, providing the user and client a nice experience, that’s why I have fundamentals on UI/UX design as well. I am mostly self-taught and i have more that 6 years of experience in iOS development. For many years i’ve been managing developers and designers for a software development side-business.

Most of the time I am working in iOS, but I develop for Android and Ruby on Rails too. On my free time I like to learn about blockchain, cryptos and web3.
